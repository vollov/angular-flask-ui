When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive,
A new child scope will be available as an injectable parameter.

Use controllers to:

-Set up the initial state of the $scope object.
-Add behavior to the $scope object.

Do not use controllers to:

-Manipulate DOM — Controllers should contain only business logic. Putting any presentation logic into Controllers significantly affects its testability. Angular has databinding for most cases and directives to encapsulate manual DOM manipulation.
-Format input — Use angular form controls instead.
-Filter output — Use angular filters instead.
-Share code or state across controllers — Use angular services instead.
-Manage the life-cycle of other components (for example, to create service instances).
